## Part 2 & 3 â€“ Design Review: Peer Assessment

### Step 1: Your Response
You should have completed this in Part 1.

### Step 2: Learn to Assess Responses
- Practice using this sample layout:  
  `EBeam_ImaginaryStudentA.gds`  
  > *Note: Created using an older version of KLayout/SiEPIC tools. Verification may not work.*

### Step 3: Assess Peers

- Assess several peer submissions using the **Design Review Checklist** rubric.
- Peer designs will be available once they are submitted. If none appear, check again later.
- Download the **merged EBeam.gds** and locate the peerâ€™s layout using the provided fork name or filename.
- If the layout is not visible in the merged file, also check individual forks. Some peers may not have submitted a pull request.
